# Assignment 42_school. Rush00.

• Classes will have to be in Coplien’s form, without us asking. It’s a pre-requisite to have a positive grade. Be thorough.

• Your program must be compiled with a proper Makefile, and the executable must be named ft_retro.

Here are the basic requirements :

• Single-player

• Display using the ncurses library

• Horizontal or vertical scrolling (The screen area moves through the world, very much like in R-Type for example)

• Random enemies

• The player can shoot at enemies

• Basic collision handling (If an enemy touches you, you die)

Here are some of bonuses:

• Displaying score, time, number of lives, etc... on screen

• Clock-based timing (Use whichever system facility or library you like)

• Entities that can occupy multiple squares

• Enemies can also shoot

• Scenery (Collidable objects or simple background)

My game looks like this:
